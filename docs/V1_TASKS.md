# Tasks for V1 (not for this temporary session)

Recorded here so they are not lost; the project's task list lives on Drive
(AI News Desk — Project Task List) and Rafi copies them there (rule 0).

1. (2 Oct 2026) PLAIN ENGLISH GATE for every card, Headlines line and article. Before any render
   or JSON fill, every headline and body passes two checks: (a) a script check against
   Article_phrasing_instructions_AIND_V1 (sentences of at most 15 words, the banned words, no
   "X reports that" opening on a card, at most one number per sentence); (b) a stranger check:
   a fresh agent that has not seen the story retells each item in one sentence a 12-year-old
   would say; if it cannot, the item fails. Results go to Rafi as a table before render.
   Headline model (Rafi, 2 Oct 2026): first the deed in picture words, then the explanation
   underneath. Reference example: card 13 of 2 Oct 2026, before and after.
   Naming: call the rules file by its Drive name, Article_phrasing_instructions_AIND_V1, never
   by its inside title; the file's own first line still carries the old title (Rafi's edit).

## Rules of the last three days that live only in this repo and should go into the V1 Drive files (listed 2 Oct 2026, Rafi's ask)

1. 24 hour scan window, 30 only on request (CLAUDE.md 16). No Drive file has it.
2. The 55 sources read directly after Google News, 15 to 20 stories per category (CLAUDE.md 16, SKILL step 1b). No Drive file has it.
3. One company at most 2 Headlines stories and 3 story cards (CLAUDE.md 16). Not in Cards or Headlines rules.
4. The 13 slot template, Bigger Picture as its own clip 11, stored ending in slot 13 (SKILL, fill script). Headlines rules still say twelve slots.
5. Hologram border and text free symbol lines in the generation prompt (fill script, 30 Sep). Not in the Drive prompt file.
6. Clip seconds rounded up to the next half second (CLAUDE.md 16). Drive rule B1a says do not round; Rafi to settle.
7. Bigger Picture as market summation plus things to watch, at three lengths, with a Bulletin section (CLAUDE.md 17, build_products.py). Not in Full Report, Bulletin or Cards rules.
8. Headline model (the deed in picture words first), 15 word sentences, stranger check (task 1 above). Not in Article_phrasing_instructions_AIND_V1.
9. Repeat check against the last three days of cards and Headlines, not only yesterday's pool.
10. Rule files called by their Drive name only.
11. 8 sampler steps, the 4 second voice sample, the unhurried presenter tone (CLAUDE.md 16, 2 Oct). Headlines rules say six steps; the prompt file has the old tone. Move after the 2 Oct clips prove it.
12. Opening and ending regenerated as options on request, stored ones stay approved until Rafi picks (CLAUDE.md 16, 2 Oct).
Already in Drive, nothing to port: report and Bulletin cutoffs, Fun Side top 3 in the Bulletin, bypassed opening and ending.
